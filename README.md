# gh-activity-scraper
Scrapes github activity for a user and checks for tetris pieces in it. Easily modifiable.

Any activity => 1.
No activity => 0.

```
python main.py <username>
```

If you want to look for different shapes, modify shapes.py. Make sure to read the whole file so you don't end up with extra shapes.
